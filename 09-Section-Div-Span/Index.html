        <h2 style="color: white;text-align: center;">GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h2>
        <p>All computers have graphics hardware that handles everything from displaying your desktop and decoding videos
            to rendering demanding PC games. Most modern PCs have graphics processing units (GPUs) made by <span
                style="color: blue;">Intel</span>, <span style="color: yellowgreen;">NVIDIA</span>, or <span
                style="color: red;">AMD</span>, but remembering <span style="color: white;">which model you have
                installed can be</span> difficult.</p>

        <h5 style="color: white;text-align: center;">HISTORY</h5>
        <p>Graphics cards historically supported different computer display standards as they evolved. For the IBM PC
            compatibles, common early standards were MDA, CGA, Hercules, EGA and VGA.

            In the late 1980s the like of Radius produced graphics cards for the Apple Macintosh II with discrete 2D
            QuickDraw capabilities.[7]

            3dfx Interactive was one of the first companies to develop a consumer-facing GPU with 3D acceleration (with
            the Voodoo series) and the first to develop a graphical chipset dedicated to 3D, but without 2D support
            (which therefore required the presence of a 2D card to work).

            NVIDIA RIVA 128 was one of the first consumer-facing GPU integrated 3D processing unit and 2D processing
            unit on a chip.

            The majority of modern graphics cards are built with either AMD-sourced or Nvidia-sourced graphics chips.[8]
            Most graphics cards offer various functions such as 3D rendering, 2D graphics, video decoding, TV output,
            and the ability to connect multiple monitors (multi-monitor). Graphics cards also have sound card
            capabilities to output sound along with video output for connected TVs or monitors with integrated speakers.

            Within the industry, graphics cards are sometimes called graphics add-in-boards, <span
                style="color: white;">abbreviated as AIBs,[8] with the word "graphics"</span> usually omitted.</p>
