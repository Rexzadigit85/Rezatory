                    software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
                    collaborated on a joint request for first publicly funding, but the project was not formally adopted
                    by CERN. In
                    his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used";
                    an encyclopedia is the first entry.

                    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",first
                    mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising
                    the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly
                    influenced by SGMLguid, an Generalized Markup Standard Language in-house Standard
