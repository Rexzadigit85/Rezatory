        <h2>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h2>
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
        This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and
        control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural
        content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the
        file and its formatting.
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles
        for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
        reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is
        accessed on a mobile device.[4]
